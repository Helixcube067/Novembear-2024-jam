    "The trip back felt shorter than I remembered, though being carried probably had something to do with that. Though my ankle and pride stung a bit, Hustace was...{w=0.75}gentle with me."
    "It was honestly more than a little embarrassing. Still, it beat walking, so there I was."
    "I was ready for Hustace to set me down at the front of the store. Only for him to keep carrying me right through the front door."

    Hustace "I mean to have a word with Gertrude first."
    "Before I could protest, he barged through the front door with a slam. At her counter, Gertrude sat looking over a ledger, not even looking up as Hustace stormed in."

    Ger "Hello Hustace. I hope you got your honey."
    Hustace "Gertrude!!!"
    Hustace "What is the meaning of this?"
    "Gertrude glanced up at me, tipped her glasses down just enough to look at me, and it was the first time I noticed she only had one eye."
    Ger "It appears to be a fox, Hustace.{w} Perhaps you ought to check on your chickens."

    "Hustace dropped me, almost in surprise, and I caught myself on my paws, only for a sharp twinge to remind me why I was being carried in the first place."
    "I tipped to the side, and Hustace was forced to catch me again, setting me aside as I let out a grumble."

    "Okay, it wasn't {i}his{/i} fault I'd hurt my foot, but still."
    Hustace "What were you thinking, Getrude?"
    Hustace "She could have gotten lost! Even as it was she nearly got flattened by a tree and managed to sprain her leg. A girl like that shouldn't be out wandering around in the wild."
    "He folded his arms and stared Gerty down."
    Hustace "You know full well that it's already getting cold enough to freeze at night."
    Ger "Well, you could always come in and pick up the honey yourself."
    "Gertrude pulls her sunglasses off fully and wiping them casually with a cloth before setting them back on her nose."

    Hustace "I am {i}fine{/i}. I'm sorry I'm not the hellraiser I was in my youth. I'm old and my joints hurt. I don't like coming into town every other day."
    Ger "Yes, those old joints of your just prefer chopping trees and hauling grown women several miles over rough terrain."
    "Gertrude clucked her tongue and resumed flipping through her ledger"
    Ger "In any case it's not up to you. Our young lady here is busy doing community service, and it's my {i}responsibility{/i} to see her serving the community."
    Hustace "So have her do deliveries in town! Shovel some snow!"
    "He gestured at me, which surprised me as everyone seemed to have otherwise forgotten I was there."
    Hustace "You don't send her out alone into the woods."
    Ger "{i}I{/i} will send here where she's {i}needed{/i} Hustace. And if you don't like it, you can take it up with...{w} Well, me, I suppose. Your complaint is duly noted."

    Ger "If you feel so strongly about our fox here going hiking, you can come in and get your honey yourself."
    Hustace "I-"
    Hustace "{i}Fine{/i}. But I don't want to see you roping other folks into your {i}schemes{/i} anymore."
    "She batted her eyelashes (eyelash? I mean one eye still had eyelashes, didn't it?) at him, before they disappeared behind her glasses again."
    Ger "Oh Hustace, don't be absurd."

    Vicky "No, no, I mean let me make 'deliveries' for you."
    Vicky "Tell Gerty we had a talk and you're comfortable with me going back out with you. Then, you come into town, sign for the carton in town, and I can pretend I'm hiking through the woods for several hours."
