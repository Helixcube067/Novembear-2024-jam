    "By the third mile I'm positively sweating. How is the forest this warm in december?"
    "I sit down and drop my pack on the ground, and let my poor aching feet rest a minute on a nearby stump."
    "'Learn the trail before it gets snowy!' Gerty had told me. 'You'll thank me later!' Yeah, I'm gonna be reserving judgement on that, big time."
    "As I sit there, it dawns on me how incredibly quiet the forest is. The only thing I can hear is my own breathing. There are no cars, no voices, not even wind through the leaves."
    "There's just utter, {w=0.75}impossible, {w=0.75}silence."
    "I smooth down my fur as it fluffs up of its own accord. It doesn't feel natural, but that's absurd, this is as natural as it gets."
    "There's a thunk in the distance."
    "I bolt to my feet, looking around, but then I realize just how far away the sound is. Then my heart falls as I realize how {i}far{/i} the sound is."
    "Why does everything out here have to be miles apart. Though I suppose I wouldn't have a job if it wasn't."
    "Setting my aching paws back on the trail, I follow it towards that rhythmic thunk."
    "As I crest a hill, I find myself staring over more barren forest, broken only by a splash of red plaid and blue denim against the dead brown of fallen leaves."

    "It's a bear, and a bear of a bear at that, swinging an axe into a tree. I stop and watch as he obliterates whole chunks of wood from the tree before him with each swing."
    "Could that be that Hustace bear I'm supposed to meet?"

    "I set my eyes back to the trail and start to pick my way down, careful not to trip as the uneven footing fights me. Roots and rocks try to trip me up, and I'm still picking my way down as a heavy rustling and cracking cuts the silence."
    "I look up just in time to notice the giant tree the bear had been working on starting to list and tumble."
    "I only now realize how close I've gotten.{w} And that it's falling towards me."
    "Fuck."
    mysDad "Look out!"
    "A voice roars at me, but years of drunk dodging cross-walk traffic haven't been for nothing." 
    "I throw myself forward as that hammer of wood and branches crashes down close enough to leave twigs in my tail." with sshake
    "Suddenly, one of those sneaky roots takes my paw the wrong way, and pain lances up my leg as I go down with a yelp."
    "Suddenly I'm in shadow, and my heart freezes as that bear looms over me. Somehow he seems even larger than the tree as he looms over me, a dark shadow blotting out the sky, his face an angry glower."

    mysDad "Dammit, Gertrude! I've told her a hundred times."
    "Easily hefting me around, I find my paw being held and examined as I dangle upside down, my pack tumbling askew."
    mysDad "Doesn't look broken. Can you wiggle your paw?"
    Vicky "Can I..."
    "I belatedly remember that I'm not a sack of potatoes." 
    Vicky "Put me down!"
    mysDad "Oh, uh, sorry there. Old habits."
    "He flips me back upright with embarrassing ease, and I wince as my paw only barely manages to take my weight."
    "I try to heft my pack back into place, but at that moment my paw decides to give out, and again I'm in the huge bear's grasp."
    mysDad "Ah hell, even if it's not broken, you're not walking on that."
    #not sure about this next part
    Vicky "I'll be fine!"
    "I huff, my dignity again bruised via manhandling."
    Vicky "And put me down!"
    mysDad "Right, sorry."
    "He sets me down, and now that I'm a little more on balance, figuratively and literally, I can finally get a good look at him."

    "He's a bear even by bear standards. Tall, wide, hairy, scruffy. Man looks like could get hit by a car then apologize to the car."
    "He's frowning for the moment, but it's one of those concerned frowns, the kind that the school councilers always had when they asked about who you were spending time with."
    Vicky "You Hustace?"
    Hustace "That's me,{w=0.75} you brought one of those care packages?"
    "In reply I just heft the pack off and thrust it at him. He takes it with a long suffering sigh, and rubs his face." 
    "I'd have placed him in his mid thirties when I first saw him, but in that moment he seems easily twice that and some change."

    Hustace "Ah hell, Gert, why won't you just leave well enough alone?"
    "He flips open the pack and snorts."
    Hustace "Don't even like honey, you old biddy."
    Vicky "Well,"
    "I cut in, wincing as I shift my footing."

    Hustace "Now, hold up there. Don't go haring off into the woods like that. Even if your paw ain't broken, you're just gonna hurt it worse. Let me help."
    "Again I'm scooped up into his arms, and I can't help but flush from about 80%% indignation."
    Vicky "H-hey! I'm supposed to be bringing the food to you. And I can take care of myself!"
    "Admittedly, as much as this whole community service gig irritates me, I'm certainly not going to phone it in. Certainly not if it means Gertrude might not sign off on my service."
    Hustace "I'm sure you can,"
    "he said in tones of {i}obvious{/i} placation."
    Hustace "But it don't sit right with me, you coming all this way and hurting yourself because somebody wants to be a busybody."
    Hustace "Come on, ain't no shame in having a little help."
    "I feel an argument rising in my throat again, but the throbbing of my paw smothers it. My feet were already hurting before one was nearly twisted off by this stupid forest."
    "Might as well make the best of it."
    "As the silence begins to press in again, my fur starts to prickle."

    Vicky "So, uh,{w} you don't like honey?"
    "He sighs and rolls his eyes, frowning off into the middle distance as he carries me up the trail."
    Hustace "No, and that old biddy knows it too. She's always been a troublemaker. Probably figures if the honey won't work she'll try the vinegar instead."
    Vicky "But she sent honey."
    "Hustace groans."
    Hustace "I mean, it's like the old saying. Catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Means being sweet gets you more stuff. Except I won't move into town no matter how much she and the girls beg."
    Hustace "So if she can't wheedle me into town, she's gonna try and annoy me into it."
    "I think about that a moment."
    Vicky "So the honey is vinegar?"

    "He lets out that sigh that only parents can do, and I immediately find myself prickling."

    "He shoots me a look that just makes me giggle more."
    Vicky "{cps=10}Relaaaaxxx{/cps}. {w=0.75}See it's all just harmless fun, and you're hardly one to judge"
    Hustace "I am perfectly one to judge, {w} I settled down, met a nice girl that didn't need me to crash tractors to impress her, and had two lovely daughters and lots of wonderful, responsible friends."
    Vicky "Who now send you honey and irresponsible foxes to pester you."
    "He grumbled again."
