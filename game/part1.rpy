    mysGer "So what brings you out to Verschlafener Bach?"
    "For a moment I pretend not to hear her, the sound of her voice almost drowned out by the clatter of shot-out suspension over gravel."
    "Every bump and sway makes the whole truck rattle like an old garage toolbox, and I grip the door handle a little harder just to make sure the thing doesn't fall off its hinges."
    "Outside, more green streams by than I've ever seen in my life. Trees after trees after trees, like an endless hallway into the wild."
    "The moments stretch on, and I start to feel silly. I was told it was going to be a several hour drive, and here I am already sulking like a little kid."
    "It's not her fault I'm here. Just just a sweet country bumpkin trying to be friendly."

    Vicky "I got in trouble."
    mysGer "Oh, well I gathered that much, dearie!"
    "She laughs warmly, making me feel like even more of a kid, but not quite in a bad way."
    Ger "Ol' Gerty wants details!"
    "For a moment, I feel a pang of pity. Of course she'd want to make conversation. This is probably the most interesting thing that's happened to her all year."
    "I sat a little straighter, the seat upholstry popping a few stitches."

    "Name's Vicky. Vic to my friends, 'the V' to those who wanna be my friends, and 'V the B' to anyone unlucky enough not to make those lists."
    "Yes, I was that kind of girl, the kind other girls want to be seen with, and the boys just want to be with. I was pretty,{w=0.75} witty,{w=0.75} and actually fashionable{w=0.75}, none of that store-bought brand-name crap. Your party wasn't a party until the V showed up."

    "It was all thanks to a little rat, literally and figuratively, by the name of Samantha."
    "Credit where credit's due, she could have been something. Kinda cute, could at least color coordinate, I'd almost rate her a thrift-shop version of me. Problem is, she knew it too."
    "It was the biggest party of the year. Downtown, east side warehouse. They'd brought in lights, fog machines, gonna have sets by DJ HardTime (ironic in retrospect). And there I was in the center of it. Bumping, grinding, right there in the heart of the pit."
    "Too bad I was riding too high to notice when the laser show changed to flashing red and blue."
    "I only realized it was more than a boy getting a little rough when the cuffs slapped on my wrists."

    "I don't have any proof Sam called the fuzz, but I sure didn't see that little tart that night, and if there was one thing that girl desperately wanted, it was to be seen."
    "So there I was,{w=0.75} behind bars instead of at the bar,{w=0.75} waiting for some stuffed suit in a robe to tell me how many years I'd be doing."
    "As luck would have it, though,{w=0.75} they bagged so many people that night that throwing the book at us all would have probably made a bigger stink than the bust itself."
    "Somebody up top had already gotten to do their whole 'tough on crime' bit as it was, so the judge went easy on me."
    "Few hundred hours community service, and I'd be free to go. After all, wasn't like I'd shot anyone, or sold any of the drugs there myself."
    "And so ends my tale of treachery and woe. {w} Well, the treachery bit. {w} Something told me,{w=0.75} as a pothole tried to rearrange my spine,{w=0.75} that the woe was just beginning."

    "The car mercifully slows to a halt at last, and I nearly fall over getting out. It feels like I've gone 4 hours at the worlds first combination boxing ring / massage parlor, and I can barely feel my poor ass.{w} And not even in a fun way."

    "She slapped the top of the box."
    Ger "Now, out here, in case you hadn't noticed, we don't have the best roads. Diesel costs an arm and a leg, and the general store ain't exactly stocked to feed a town of hungry autumn bears."
    "She opens the box, revealing gold-yellow cardboard cartons inside. She pulls one out without even a grunt, and thumps it on the counter." with sshake
