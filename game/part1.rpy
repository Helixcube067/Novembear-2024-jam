    mysGer "So what brings you out to Verschlafener Bach?"
    "For a moment I pretend not to hear her, the sound of her voice almost drowned out by the clatter of shot-out suspension over gravel."
    "Every bump and sway makes the whole truck rattle like an old garage toolbox, and I grip the door handle a little harder just to make sure the thing doesn't fall off its hinges."
    "Outside, more green streams by than I've ever seen in my life. Trees after trees after trees, like an endless hallway into the wild."
    "The moments stretch on, and I start to feel silly. I was told it was going to be a several hour drive, and here I am already sulking like a little kid."
    "It's not her fault I'm here. Just just a sweet country bumpkin trying to be friendly."

    Vicky "I got in trouble."
    mysGer "Oh, well I gathered that much, dearie!"
    "She laughs warmly, making me feel like even more of a kid, but not quite in a bad way."
    Ger "Ol' Gerty wants details!"
    "For a moment, I feel a pang of pity. Of course she'd want to make conversation. This is probably the most interesting thing that's happened to her all year."
    "I sat a little straighter, the seat upholstry popping a few stitches."
    Vicky "Well...you see..."
    "Name's Vicky. Vic to my friends, 'the V' to those who wanna be my friends, and 'V the B' to anyone unlucky enough not to make those lists."
    "Yes, I was that kind of girl, the kind other girls want to be seen with, and the boys just want to be with. I was pretty, witty, and actually fashionable, none of that store-bought brand-name crap. Your party wasn't a party until the V showed up."
