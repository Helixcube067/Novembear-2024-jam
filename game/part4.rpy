    "You know the saying, 'careful what you wish for?' I've found through my life that I'm not very careful"
    "That thought kept bothering me as I sat on a bench at the edge of town, nursing a carton of honey. It was actually pretty good, all things considered. Great if you mixed it with some milk."
    "I perked up as I saw Hustace approaching, blushing as I noticed my belly jiggling slightly with the motion."
    "Okay, maybe the honey was a little {i}too{/i} good, but hey, at least I wasn't all that cold anymore. I waved at Hustace as he strode up, fetching up the clipboard for him."

    Hustace "Hey Vic."
    "He signed on the line as he usually did. His eye wandered up and down me as I took another swig from the honey"
    Hustace "You're not drinking that raw are you?"
    "I couldn't help but blush mid-swig, nearly choking, but deciding to finish the carton. It was {i}almost{/i} done already."
    Vicky "What, you told me I couldn't *urp* throw them out!"
    Hustace "I...{w} Fair enough. Same time next week?"

    "I took the clipboard back, but as he turned, I felt a sinking in my stomach.{w=.075} Non-honey related."
    "In truth, getting off from Gerty's schedule wasn't all I'd hoped it would be. There was no reception out in Sleepy Creek, and there wasn't much to do in town." 
    "In truth, I was almost missing Gerty's ledgers."
    "I glanced around, and my eyes crossed one of the posters I'd seen around. 'Logway days!' it proclaimed boldly, advertising a fair the next town over."
    "'Food stalls! Chainsaw carving! See the world champion of the tractor pull!' Of course, next town over meant nearly an hour's drive, to say nothing of walking. Far out of my reach."
    "However..."
    "I snatched the poster, and sprinted up to Hustace, keenly aware of the way I had started to bounce as I moved."
    Vicky "Hustace!"
    "I found myself fighting a further blush as I was already panting a bit as I caught up"
    Vicky "Didn't you used to be a tractor guy?"

    Hustace "Oh, come now, you can't be serious."

    Hustace "I'll have you know that…"
    "He faltered as I took his arm, clutching it to me as I continued to bat my eyelashes. I tried to ignore the fact that it more squished into me than squeezed. Though by his blush he certainly wasn't complaining."
    Hustace "Oh hells, it... has been a while. I suppose you're pretty bored around here, huh?"

    "! If he wasn't my only ride out, I'd have given him a piece of my mind! And I most certainly did not enjoy it a bit! And his hand certainly wasn't warm and strong. Not at all."

    "The car ride wasn't awkward, not exactly. It was more the suspension was so rickety that we couldn't have heard a word the other said anyway." 
    "As it was, the hour drive seemed to drag and slip by at the same time, the endless processions of trees lulling me into a trance."
    "It was into this that the Logway county fair {i}exploded{/i}."

    "What stunned me was the scale. I'd been to parties in the city, raves and such, but they were always crammed into sub basements and if you were lucky, a warehouse. {i}This was as large as Sleepy Creek itself{/i}!"

    "I'd finally gotten myself back under control by the time we pulled into a cleared lot, parked among a dozen rows of other trucks. I hopped out and smoothed out my outfit, when a soft beep caught my ear."
    "I dug around in my pocket, and gasped as my phone displayed some messages. I was getting a signal!"
    "A few seconds of quick scrolling revealed most everyone thought I was dead. Or in a maximum security prison. I couldn't help but giggle at the absurdity of it."
    Hustace "Whatcha got there? Is that a phone?"
    Vicky "Yeah, first time I've had reception!"
    "I hovered my finger over the reply button, but suddenly something about it felt… impolite. The messages had waited the past few weeks, and here was hustace having driven me this far."
    "They could wait a little longer."
