    "She had clocked me. I was feeling strangely... Self conscious. Almost enough to want to avoid facing him and these feelings."
    "But somehow my phone got left in his truck."
    Ger "It must have fallen out on your way back," 
    "Gertrude offered this obvious excuse. I could have sworn there was a twinkle in her eye as she said it."
    Vicky "I guess I'll set up another time to see him then."
    Ger "Oh I suppose that's best, dearie."
    "Gertrude's cackle seemed a bit more wistful as she left me alone in my room."

    "Me and Hustace spent most of our spare time in each other's company. It turned out there was actually a lot to do around sleepy creek. It seemed that there were always barbecues and little parties going on between family and friends." 
    "Over and over I'd hear the same things. “Hustace! Long time no see!” “Good to see you again, Hustace!” “Hustace you old dog!” It turned out, contrary to the old recluse I'd met, he'd been quite the character back in the day."

    "It took me a moment, and I finally blushed"
    Vicky "It's the place we first met."
    "My heart skipped a beat, and this time not from exertion. Was he actually going to do something romantic? He started to get to one knee, and I started to feel dizzy."
    Hustace "You know, when we first met, I…" 
    "He coughed." 
    Hustace "Well, that is…" 
    "I could make out him digging into his shirt pocket, and the crinkling of paper."
    Hustace "Oh bother, why did I try to do this at night?"
    "I fought down a giggle."
    Vicky "Did you actually write down a speech?"
    Hustace "It seemed like a good idea at the time!" 
    "He muttered, squinting at the scrap of paper in the moonlight."

    Hustace "Ah, thanks."
    "I didn't need to see him properly to know he was blushing too. He tried to fumble the phone in one hand while holding the crumpled paper open enough to read in the other, then snorted and tossed the paper away."
    Hustace "Ah blast it. Vic? Do you wanna, you know, maybe… go out proper like?"
    "I laughed at that. Both feeling my heart flutter at his precious reaction and giddy that this was happening" 
    Vicky "That's all? Good lord, I thought you were about to propose!"
    "He visibly jumped at that, making me chuckle again"
    Hustace "What?!"
    "I decided to needle him a bit. Gently teasing him, as we always did to each other."
    Vicky "I mean, I know folks tend to be a bit faster about these things in the country, but goodness, Hustace, I haven't even met your daughters~"
    Hustace "Er, no! Of course! I mean, you should, that is…" 
    "I hopped up, and gave him a smooch before he could splutter further."
    Vicky "Easy, Big guy"
    "I cupped his head between my paws, feeling his sturdy and handsome features under my fingers."
    Vicky "I think I would like to...{w} {i}Go out proper like~{/i}"
